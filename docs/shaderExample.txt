// Gradient Noise (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_noise), not to be confused with
// Value Noise, and neither with Perlin's Noise (which is one form of Gradient Noise)
// is probably the most convenient way to generate noise (a random smooth signal with 
// mostly all its energy in the low frequencies) suitable for procedural texturing/shading,
// modeling and animation.
//
// It produces smoother and higher quality than Value Noise, but it's of course slighty more
// expensive.
//
// The princpiple is to create a virtual grid/latice all over the plane, and assign one
// random vector to every vertex in the grid. When querying/requesting a noise value at
// an arbitrary point in the plane, the grid cell in which the query is performed is
// determined, the four vertices of the grid are determined and their random vectors
// fetched. Then, the position of the current point under  evaluation relative to each
// vertex is doted (projected) with that vertex' random vector, and the result is
// bilinearly interpolated with a smooth interpolant.
